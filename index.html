                <p align = "justify">   Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionised the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by improving contextual understanding, zero-shot and few-shot learning, text generation, and question answering. However, LLMs have limitations such as accuracy, bias, interpretability, and context. They often produce factually inaccurate information, struggle to understand complex contexts, and may unintentionally produce biased or stereotyped information. KGs, on the other hand, have high-quality explicit knowledge, symbolic reasoning potential, and the ability to evolve with new knowledge, making them essential for various applications. The intersection of LLMs and KGs has sparked significant interest and innovation in NLP. LLM-enhanced KGs can be introduced into pre-training and inference stages to provide external knowledge and assess interpretability. LLM-augmented KGs are designed to improve coverage and ease the use of KGs in various tasks, including embedding learning, completion, construction, KG-to-text generation, and KGQA. Combining the benefits of LLMs and KGs can also improve performance in knowledge representation. </p>
                    
<p align = "justify">  The workshop intends to provide a platform for researchers, practitioners, and industry professionals to explore the synergies between LLMs and KGs. We aim to provide a space for the LLM community and the community of KG researchers to interact and explore how these two communities could collaborate and support one another. The goal of the workshop is to seize on the tremendous opportunities arising from investigating cutting-edge approaches, addressing challenges and limitations, and applications in different domains.

<b>Talk: The Journey to A Knowledgeable Assistant with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</b> 
<br>
For decades, multiple communities (Database, Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing, Data Mining, AI) have pursued the mission of providing the right information at the right time. Efforts span web search, data integration, knowledge graphs, question answering. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in comprehending and generating human language, revolutionizing techniques in every front. However, their inherent limitations such as factual inaccuracies and hallucinations make LLMs less suitable for creating knowledgeable and trustworthy assistants.

<br>
This talk describes our journey in building a knowledgeable AI assistant by harnessing LLM techniques. We start with our findings from a comprehensive set of experiments to assess LLM reliability in answering factual questions and analyze performance variations across different knowledge types. Next, we describe our federated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that integrates external information from both the web and knowledge graphs for trustworthy text generation on real-time topics like stocks and sports, as well as on torso-to-tail entities like local restaurants. Additionally, we brief our explorations on extending our techniques towards multi-modal, contextualized, and personalized Q\&A. We will share our techniques, our findings, and the path forward, highlighting how we are leveraging and advancing the decades of work in this area.

<b>Talk: Extracting Common Sense World Models from LLMs</b> 
<br>
LLMs are often criticized for not operating with a notion of world models, which could provide robustness, explainability, and multi-hop reasoning. In this keynote, we will show the methodology and concrete examples of how to extract non-trivial symbolic world models from LLMs for an arbitrary domain. The extracted world models will be represented in an operational first-order logic; concretely in the Prolog programming language, in its basic and probabilistic versions. In the second step, the extracted world models will be used to ground textual data into the semantics of world models to enable reasoning, explanation, and possibly efficient agent communication operating with explicit representations. The approach aims to integrate black-box LLM representations with transparent symbolic representations close to humans without significant loss of information for practical applications.

<b>Talk:  Making Large Language Model’s Knowledge More Accurate, Organized, Up-to-date and Fair</b> 
<br>
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on  knowledge reasoning tasks, owing to their implicit knowledge derived from extensive pretraining data. However, their inherent knowledge bases often suffer from disorganization and illusion, bias towards common entities, and rapid obsolescence. Consequently, LLMs frequently make up untruthful information, exhibit resistance to updating outdated knowledge, or struggle with generalizing across multiple languages. In this talk, I will discuss our recent research efforts to tackle these challenges. I will begin by presenting theoretical and empirical analyses that illuminate when and why LLMs frequently produce factual errors and struggle to determine knowledge-updating boundaries in order to reach the “ripple effect”. Our investigations reveal several underlying causes. First, LLMs acquire implicit knowledge primarily through attention-weighted associations between words, rather than explicit understanding of concepts, entities, attributes, relations, events, semantic roles, and logics. Second, frequent word associations overshadow uncommon ones due to training data imbalance and wide context, particularly in contexts involving dynamic events. Third, counter-intuitive updating behaviours are elucidated through a novel gradient similarity metric. Fourth, LLMs are often unaware of real-world events occurring after their pretraining phase, complicating the anchoring of related knowledge updates. While existing methods focus largely on updating entity attributes, our research underscores the necessity of updating factual knowledge—such as participants, semantic roles, time, and location—based on real-world events. We propose a novel framework for knowledge updating in LLMs that leverages event-driven signals to identify factual errors preemptively and introduce a training-free self-contrastive decoding approach to mitigate inference errors.

<b>Talk: Understanding and Navigating Human Control and Transparency in LLMs</b> 
<br>
Language models are an exciting technology that has transformed our field and is used by millions of people daily. However, both users and researchers often find themselves puzzled by LLM’s responses and struggle to understand the underlying decision processes or attribute their responses to specific data sources. I will talk about our work which tries to enhance the transparency of these models for human users, ensure their behaviour is systematic, and uncover the sources of their decisions. This transparency should enable finer control of these models, including model editing, the unlearning of undesirable behaviours or data sources, and the integration of extra information (e.g., in the form of knowledge bases). 

<br>
In this talk, I will discuss the approaches my group (as well as colleagues) have been developing, highlighting not only methods but also some cautious lessons learned along the way. This includes pitfalls in data attribution and the challenges of guiding model responses with human rationale. Although progress in these areas may seem slow and sometimes illusory, it is a crucial direction, given the growing reliance on collaboration between humans and large language models. I also hope to convince you that this area holds a diverse range of intriguing open problems for us, researchers, to explore.
